## Preclinical Imaging
<!--Example: High-Throughput Screening-->

### Description
Data produced on animals using imaging techniques like MR, PET/MR, PET/CT.

### Type of data/experiments/methods
#### MR Imaging
- Digital Imaging and COmmunications in Medicine format [DICOM](https://fairsharing.org/bsg-s000114)

#### NMR spectroscopy
- [Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Markup Language](https://fairsharing.org/bsg-s000563)

### Metadata Standards
#### DICOM standards
- Ontologies and Controlled vocabularies: [DICOM Controlled Terminology](https://fairsharing.org/bsg-s000828)

### Storage and Computing
<!--Add information about e.g. NeLS-->
 See [RDMkit XNAT-PiC Assembly](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/xnat_pic_assembly)

### Data Deposition Repository

#### Repository
- Presently, there are no available national or international platforms dedicated to storing and making available for re-use the type of imaging data produced by NORMOLIM.
- For long term data storage, an option might be the National e-Infrastructure for Research Data [NIRD RESEARCH DATA ARCHIVE](https://archive.norstore.no/). This service is owned and operated by [Sigma2](https://www.sigma2.no/research-data-archive)

### Ethics and Regulations
<!--Add information about laws and policies in Norway for relevant data types-->
All the work with laboratory animals performed at NORMOLIM is subject to
- Norwegian law, the Animal welfare act (LOV-2009-06-19-97),
- the Norwegian Regulation on Animal Experimentation (FOR-2015-06-18-761)
- the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals Used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes  (ETS 123)
Moreover, it has be approved by the Norwegian authority on animal welfare (Forsøksdyrutvalget)

Work involving genetically modified microorganisms (including bacteria, virus and viral vectors) and animals must be conducted in accordance with the Norwegian Regulation on Enclosed Use of Genetically Modified Microorganisms (FOR-2001-12-21-1600) and Regulation on Genetically Modified Animals (FOR-2001-12-21-1602), and must be reported to the Norwegian Directorate of Health.

### Services in Norway

#### RDM Services
An overview of the data management resources in Norway is to be found at [RDMkit](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/no_resources).

#### Scientific Services
- NORMOLIM [Contact Information / Website Link](https://normolim.w.uib.no/)
- NORMOLIM is operated as a distributed node consisting of three sites located in Trondheim (NTNU), Bergen (UiB) and Oslo (OUS). All the research groups involved collaborate closely with the university hospitals and are directly involved in clinical research on translation of new knowledge, new therapies and new methods/technology into new clinical practice.
