### Description
<!--Write about the domain, its purpose/use, and 2-3 lines on data management challenge when it comes to said domain research in Norway-->
High-throughput screening (HTS) involves automated testing of chemical and/or biological compounds against a target, typically biological. The process is automated through the use of microwell plates and/or microarrays, robotics, liquid handling, data processing, and sensitive detection systems. The detection systems are typically optical plate reader data, imaging data, or flow cytometry data.  
Screening data generated in Norway are collected using a large quantity of compounds from diverse suppliers that are tested against a variety of targets in many different assay types using various detection methods. Such heterogeneities make unifying HTS data generated in Norway an ongoing challenge.
