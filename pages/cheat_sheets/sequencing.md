### Description
We provide here a collection of resources, tools, and standards relevant for short-read and long-read sequencing data.

## Type of data/experiments/methods
<!---When mentioning file format, it would be useful to mention format type -->

#### Commonly used raw file formats for sequencing data
Most of these raw file formats are usually converted to BAM (and FASTQ file formats) for data processing and bioinformatics analysis.
- [FASTA](https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.rz4vfg)
- [FASTQ Sequence and Sequence Quality Format](https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.r2ts5t)
- [FASTQ Original Read Archive (ORA)](https://support-docs.illumina.com/SW/ORA_Format_Specification/Content/SW/ORA/ORAFormatSpecification.htm)
- [Illumina Binary Base Call](https://www.illumina.com/informatics/sequencing-data-analysis/sequence-file-formats.html)
- PacBio platforms generate [PacBio legacy basecall File Format (bas.h5/bax.h5)](http://files.pacb.com/software/instrument/2.0.0/bas.h5%20Reference%20Guide.pdf) and [PacBio Alignment File Format (cmp.h5)](https://pacbiofileformats.readthedocs.io/en/11.0/legacy/CmpH5Spec.html)
- Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) platforms generate [POD5 File Format](https://github.com/nanoporetech/pod5-file-format) and [Fast5](https://bioinformatics.cvr.ac.uk/exploring-the-fast5-format/) for nanopore data

## Metadata Standards
#### The [Minimum Information about any (x) Sequence (MIxS)](https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.9aa0zp) is an overarching framework of sequence metadata.
- Ontologies:
  - [Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO)](https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.1gr4tz)
  - [NCBI Taxonomy (NCBITAXON)](https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.fj07xj)

  - [Disease Ontology (DOID)](https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.8b6wfq)
  - [Environment Ontology ENVO)](https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.azqskx)
  - [Plant Ontology (PO)](https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.3ngg40)
- Controlled vocabularies:
  - [Chemical Entities of Biological Interest ChEBI)](https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.62qk8w)

#### [European Variation Archive metadata template](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eva/files/EVA_Submission_template.V1.1.4.xlsx)
This standard is required for submission of genetic variant data on [EVA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eva/)

## Sources for Reusable Data
#### [Ensembl](https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.fx0mw7)
- Ensembl creates, integrates, and distributes reference datasets and analysis tools that enable genomics.
- Data is open-access and can be downloaded free of charge ([disclaimer](https://www.ensembl.org/info/about/legal/index.html))
- Identifiers: [Ensembl stable ID](https://www.ensembl.org/Help/Faq?id=488)
- Free to access, more features with account (username and password)

## Storage and Computing
#### [ELIXIR Norway](https://elixir.no) infrastructures
- [The Norwegian e-infrastructure for Life Sciences (NeLS)](https://nels.bioinfo.no)
