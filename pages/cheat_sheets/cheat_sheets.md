We provide here a set of information (cheat sheets), for various domains in life sciences, with different approaches on how they manage their data. In this section, you will find::
- Links to data formats
- Links to meta data standards
- Links to data reuse resources
- Links to data deposition databases
- Links to exemplar Data Management Plans (DMPs), relevant to your research domain, in the [ELIXIR-NO Data Stewardship Wizard](https://elixir-no.ds-wizard.org/)

Each cheat sheet is maintained by one of the life science research infrastructures within [BioMedData in Norway](https://elixir.no/biomeddata).

To figure out what is the relevant archive/repository to submit your life sciences data, check out the [Data Submission Wizard](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/submission/) created by European Bioinformatics Institute.
